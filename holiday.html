	 <h5 class="h5 p1">Here’s the list of some of the greatest British culture, traditions and celebrations in the UK.</h5>
	 <p class="p3"><i>
1. Cheese Rolling
Cheese rolling is an unusual British tradition that involves a ball of Double Gloucester cheese and a crowd that is willing to chase it for fun.
 
It takes place on Cooper’s Hill in Gloucestershire,  with a slope so steep the participants have no choice but to stumble their way down to the finish line where, hopefully, the cheese awaits.
 
The cheese rolling event takes place every Spring Bank Holiday Monday of the year. Local participants and visitors from all over the world gather at 12 in the afternoon to participate in or witness this sport which dates back to the 15th century when people are assumed to do similar activities as harvest rituals, among other theories.

This British tradition is so dangerous that in 1997, a total of 33 competitors were injured.

	2. Morris Dancing
Morris dancing is both art and history in motion. It usually involves dancing with sticks, handkerchiefs or swords in a style that is depicted mainly by location. Some styles include Cotswold from the South Midlands and Longsword in Yorkshire.
 
This type of dance is typically performed on specific occasions and seasons such as early summer for Oxfordshire and during Christmas and New Year for Yorkshire. However, morris dancing can still be performed in other instances.
	<p class="p3"><i>
	3. Pub Culture
The term pub is a short term for “public house.” True to its word origin, a British pub is a place in the neighbourhood where people gather for drinks and discussions after the daily grind.
 
The culture prevalent in British pubs is observed to be different from American bars. A member’s only social club is also very common in British towns and villages. You can read here the Best Alcoholic British Pub Drinks To Try in The UK

Here are some of the unwritten laws in a British pub:
 
Order from the bar and not from your table. The pubs do not usually have table service.
When seated with a group, one should get the order of everybody so as not to crowd the bar.
When ordering beer, be specific: ale (dark beer), lager (light beer), bitter (light ale) or stout (very dark beer)
Most pubs only take cash for payment. Be ready as you order, but it is frowned upon to wave your bill to call the bartender’s attention.
To give tip to your server, offer him or her a drink. It will be added to your tab. If a tip jar is existent, monetary tips are welcome as well.
If someone buys you or your table a round, it is customary for the next round to be on you.
One bell from the bar means last order. Two means the bar is closed.

	4. Afternoon Tea
Afternoon Tea is probably one of the quintessentially British things to partake, afternoon tea has become a socially-acceptable and rather a delightful excuse to meet people for ‘some grub’ from 2 until 4 o’clock in the afternoon.
 
The common afternoon tea comprises of select teas, traditional scones, simple sandwiches and petite cakes. Complementing the pastries is clotted cream and fruit jams, amongst others.

The birth of the afternoon tea happened in the year 1840 when Anna Russell, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, would request for snacks in between lunch and dinner. It became a repeated occurrence, and she began inviting friends over to relish the treats with her.
 
Now, afternoon tea is served regularly around the globe, mostly as special offers in fancy hotels and English restaurants.

For £550 per couple, the Cliveden House in Berkshire easily bags the title of one of the priciest afternoon teas to be offered in England. It included expensive teas, exclusive chocolates and fancy ingredients.
	
	<p class="p3"><i>
	5. Regatta
The regatta is a boat race between the rowing teams of Oxford and Cambridge Universities.
 
The contest dates back to 1829 as a result of a challenge between two friends, Charles Wordsworth (Oxford) and Charles Merrivale (Cambridge.) Now, the race is held annually sometime during the Easter vacation on the River Thames in southwest London.

The racecourse is known as the Championship Course. It is almost 7 kilometres long and is located between Putney and Mortlake.


Wondering whoever won between the two? It was Wordsworth for Oxford. Their crew’s winning boat is sho

6. The Queen’s Speech
The Queen’s Speech, or in a lengthier title the Speech from the Throne, is a speech made by the reigning monarch at the state opening of the Parliament. Here, the queen addresses the legislature and speaks about the government agenda.

The speech is usually penned by the monarch’s advisors, with the queen having the final decision on its contents.

There have been instances that the queen will not be able to deliver her speech for some reason. In the United Kingdom, the reigning monarch can freely choose a delegate to represent her through the speech.
 
One of the British Christmas traditions is the Queen’s Speech on Christmas Day around 3 pm. This is when the reigning monarch will send her/his festive wishes and message to the public from the comfort of her own British palace or castle.
	<p class="p3"><i>
	7. Glastonbury Festival
The Glastonbury is a contemporary arts festival happening at Worthy Farm in Southwest England. It is founded by Michael Eavis in the 1970s.
 
Nowadays, it is the most celebrated music festival in the UK every summer that runs for a couple of days. Festival attire and camping tents are a must to enjoy the great vibes of the festival. A year in advance ticket booking would be suggested because the Glastonbury festival tickets typically sell in a few hours after going live.
	<p class="p3"><i>
	8. Sports
A lot of famous sports that are now widely enjoyed actually have British roots. Cricket, football, lawn tennis, rugby and golf to name but a few.
 
The most popular sport in the UK is football. Each country has its own national team. They compete with other teams from around the globe in different world tournaments such as the well-known FIFA World Cup. As people take the utmost pride in their countries being represented, fans tend to get all worked up with the competitions.
 
Aside from the international arena, football is also celebrated in local areas, with people playing in their local parks all across the land.
	<p class="p3"><i>
	9. British Food
Fish and chips is a very common takeaway food in the UK. As the name implies, it consists of fish that is fried in batter and accompanied by potato chips. Fresh cod is the most common fish used for this dish.
 
These were conventionally served wrapped in old newspaper, until a more hygienic paper counterpart replaced the wrap. A lot of restaurants offer fish and chips as Friday specials in regards to the traditional no-meat fast of Roman Catholics during Fridays.
 
Roast dinner. Roast dinner (or classically known as Sunday roast) has become one of the staple British food.

It consists of roast meat, vegetables and a variety of accompaniments such as Yorkshire pudding and English mustard. The term Sunday roast came from the said origin of this dish, wherein it is believed to be the traditional meal of British families after attending church on Sundays. The day starts by popping the meat in the oven, adding the veggies and then coming to attend mass.

10. Excess Politeness
It is quintessentially British to scatter excessive pardon me’s and thank you’s to one’s speech, they say. It may be seen in two opposing views: that of utter politeness or of complete nonsense.
 
Whichever of these two are true, there is no denying that this mannerism has made its way to the daily lives of the British people.
	<p class="p3"><i>
	11. A Good Cuppa Tea
The British population is one of the largest tea consumers in the world.

Before, it was a drink only enjoyed by the upper-class. However, as the eighteenth century entered, every social class have made drinking tea a part of their daily habit.
 
The perfect way to brew a good cup of tea is debatable up to this day. Even scientists released their own take of ‘a good cuppa tea.’ The methods vary from the type of pot used to the proper steeping time. Adding milk to one’s tea is also a huge subject being discussed upon.

The British Empire Tea Bureau released an instructional film about the proper serving of tea in the late 1940s. The instructions are as follows:

Always use good-quality tea.
Use freshly-drawn water.
Warm the pot.
Measure tea carefully in the correct proportion to the water.
Use just-boiled water.
Let the tea infuse properly before serving.
 
Adding milk is a must for a good brew!

12. Maypole
The maypole is a symbol in Britain traditionally signifying community gatherings. It is a stick highly decorated with attached hooks, attractive flowers and colourful papers. During May day, dancers circle around the pole with ribbons.
 

The tallest maypole in Britain stands 88 feet at North Yorkshire.
	<p class="p3"><i>13. Highland Games
The Highland Games are proudly Scottish. They include competitions on hammer throwing, hill racing and tug of war – to name a few.

The largest highland games assembly in the world is the Cowal Highland Gathering held in Argyll, Scotland. It is estimated the number of guests amounts to 23,000 visitors.
	<p class="p3"><i>14. Horse Racing
Because horse breeding has long been part of the British legacy, it is only natural to have horse racing as an esteemed part of the society. In fact, it is the second-largest spectator sport in Britain. Horse racing events include the Royal Ascot, Grand National and the Cheltenham Festival.
 
The history of racing horses dates back to the 12th century when the English knights carried Arab horses on their way back from the Crusades. These horses, crossbred with the English horses, gave birth to the Thoroughbred horse which is the breed being used in racing in the UK.


Betting on horses is a popular and legal activity in the UK. The Grand National is one of the most awaited horse racing event every year.
	<p class="p3"><i>15. Bonfire Night
Bonfire night is a celebration in Britain commemorating the failure of the plan to assassinate King James I in 1605.
 
This plan is known as the Gunpowder plot. One prominent member of the English Catholics who collaborated for the plan was Guy Fawkes. That is why Bonfire night is considered synonymous to Guy Fawkes Night. This event is celebrated on November 5.
 
On this night, bonfires are lit and people gather to enjoy treats warmed by the fire. Fireworks also fill the night sky as different forms of entertainment keep the crowd occupied. An effigy of Guy Fawkes is burned and destroyed during the celebration.
	<p class="p3"><i>
 
16. British Pop Culture
The UK has a rich pop culture that is influential not only in Britain but also in the international scene. British pop culture imports talents that transcend varied forms of media. Below are some of the most prominent contributions of Britain to the pop world:
 
The Beatles. They were a rock band hailing from Liverpool, England. The band is comprised of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. The Beatles are responsible for the pop hits such as Blackbird and I Want to Hold Your Hand.

Harry Potter. This famous book (and film) character is the brainchild of English writer J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter is the lead character of a seven-part series that won awards and acclamations from awarding bodies and the reading public. The first book written of him is entitled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.

Knowing and appreciating the British culture will give you a deeper and meaningful sense of Britishness on how we do things around the British Isles. It is undeniable that British traditions and celebrations make this little nation worth visiting to experience the true British vibes.
